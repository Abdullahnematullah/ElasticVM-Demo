# Elastic VM Provisioning and Monitoring on AWS

This project simulates elastic virtual machine provisioning and performance monitoring using AWS services. It includes Apache server setup, CPU load generation via stress-ng, and visualization through AWS CloudWatch.

## ‚úÖ Technologies Used
- Amazon EC2 (t3.micro)
- Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
- Apache HTTP Server
- stress-ng (for CPU load testing)
- AWS CloudWatch (monitoring)

## üåê Public EC2 IP
Test page accessible at:  
**http://54.234.15.24**

## üìÅ Repository Contents
- `commands.txt`: Terminal commands executed during the simulation
- `screenshots/`: Contains visual proof of instance provisioning, Apache web server test, stress-ng execution, and CloudWatch monitoring
- `architecture.jpg`: Diagram of system architecture and data flow
